       "[{'text': 'BROWNING, Justice.\\nDefendant was convicted of first-degree murder in the perpetration of a felony and was sentenced by Cowper, J. to life imprisonment at the 20 June 1977 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Wayne County. On 6 July 1984 defendant, appearing pro se, filed a Motion for Appropriate Relief in Superior Court, Wayne County alleging inter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel. Resident Superior Court Judge R. Michael Bruce appointed counsel to represent defendant. Defendant filed an Amended Motion for Appropriate Relief on 17 September 1984. This motion was heard by Lane, J. at the 9 November 1984 Criminal Session of Superior Court, Wayne County. After making findings of fact and conclusions of law, Judge Lane entered an order denying relief on 20 December 1984.\\nDefendant bases his Motion for Appropriate Relief on the failure of his trial counsel to communicate plea offers made by the district attorney before and during defendant’s trial for murder and robbery. Specifically, defendant claims that the district attorney, Donald Jacobs, offered defendant, through his trial counsel, Herbert Hulse, Sr., a ten year sentence in exchange for a guilty plea by defendant to a lesser charge. Defendant alleges that Hulse never communicated this offer to him at any time and that Hulse’s failure to communicate the alleged plea offer constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In conclusion, defendant contends that the superior court’s findings of fact did not support a denial of his Motion for Appropriate Relief but rather compel a conclusion that appropriate relief is warranted in this case.\\nThe standard for determining whether there has been a violation of a criminal defendant’s sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel was set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 80 L.Ed. 2d 674 (1984). In Strickland, the Supreme Court set forth a two-prong test to be used in analyzing ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Under this test the defendant must show,, first, that counsel’s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant to such a degree as to deprive him of a fair trial. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. at 687, 80 L.Ed. 2d at 693. The Strickland test was specifical ly adopted by the Supreme Court of North Carolina in State v. Braswell, 312 N.C. 553, 324 S.E. 2d 241 (1985).\\nIn State v. Simmons, 65 N.C. App. 294, 309 S.E. 2d 493 (1983) the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that, absent a showing of extenuating circumstances, failure to inform a client of a plea bargain offer constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. In Simmons, affidavits were filed by the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case, counsel representing the defendant, and counsel representing a codefendant acknowledging that a plea had in fact been offered by the assistant district attorney. Counsel for the defendant erroneously believed that the plea offer was conditioned on acceptance by the codefendant and failed to inform his client of the offer after the codefendant refused to accept the plea. Affidavits filed by the other parties present at the meeting indicated that the offer was not conditional on acceptance by both defendants but was rather an unconditional offer. Based upon these affidavits, the court ruled that the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had been violated.\\nIn the case sub judiee, defendant’s Motion for Approriate Relief is based upon N.C.G.S. §§ 15A-1415(b)(3) and (b)(6), contending that his conviction was obtained in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of North Carolina in that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. N.C.G.S. § 15A-1420(c) sets forth the procedural rules to be used in hearings on Motions for Appropriate Relief. Pursuant to N.C.G.S. § 15A-1420(c)(5), “[i]f an evidentiary hearing is held, the moving party has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence every fact essential to support the motion.” Therefore, in this case defendant had the burden during the evidentiary hearing of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a definite plea offer was made by the district attorney to Mr. Hulse.\\nIn State v. Stevens, 305 N.C. 712, 291 S.E. 2d 585 (1982), this Court held that in reviewing orders denying a defendant’s Motion for Appropriate Relief, findings of fact made by the trial judge are binding upon the petitioner if they are supported by evidence. This Court in Stevens further stated that this rule would apply even though the evidence presented at the hearing was conflicting and notwithstanding the defendant’s testimony at the hearing to the contrary. State v. Stevens, 305 N.C. at 720, 291 S.E. 2d at 591; State v. Baker, 312 N.C. 34, 40, 320 S.E. 2d 670, 675 (1984); State v. Bush, 307 N.C. 152, 168, 297 S.E. 2d 563, 573 (1982).\\nIn his order denying defendant’s motion, Judge Lane made numerous findings of fact. Specifically as to the existence of a plea offer, Judge Lane found:\\n16. That the District Attorney for the State does not recall whether or not if he communicated an offer to the Defendant’s attorney for a plea bargain;\\n17. That the Attorney for the Defendant does not recall any such offer, and did not communicate such an offer;\\nLastly, it should be noted that Judge Lane made no finding of fact that there was any direct communication of a definite plea offer between Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Hulse.\\nAfter a careful review of the motion hearing transcript, we also find no evidence that there was any direct offer of a definite plea between Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Hulse. Specifically the motion hearing transcript includes sworn testimony by Mr. Hulse that he never received a plea offer from Mr. Jacobs. At the motion hearing Mr. Hulse testified about the alleged offer of a plea bargain as follows:\\nMr. Jacobs, I, uh, was never offered by anybody at anytime to my recollection a proposal to plead Ernest Martin guilty in exchange for a — sentence of ten years. I know I never received any such offer from you. I know you and I never discussed it, uh, from that standpoint. There might have been some vague discussions about a plea of guilty and leaving the punishment up to the Judge. . . .\\nAdditionally, the transcript shows that Mr. Hulse reaffirmed this statement on several other occasions during direct and cross examination. Finally, District Attorney Jacobs stated during the hearing that, “I searched by memory and I cannot definitely say one way or another whether or not I offered any plea, whether or not I didn’t offer any plea. I just don’t remember.” Therefore, the factual situation in the case sub judice is in sharp contrast to that in Simmons, as here there is no evidence that a definitive plea of fer was ever made between the district attorney and the defense counsel.\\nWe do not find it unusal that Mr. Jacobs might fail, in 1984, to remember the events of a case which happened some seven years earlier. Where, as in this case, defendant had knowledge of the alleged wrong immediately after trial and failed to timely raise the issue, it is not unreasonable to surmise that memories would be faded and that defendant would be unable to carry the required burden of proof.\\nAfter a careful examination of the evidence, as preserved in the motion hearing record, we cannot find that defendant has satisfied his burden of proof by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a definite plea offer was made by the district attorney to Mr. Hulse. Additionally, as there is evidence to support the findings of fact made by Judge Lane, we are compelled to uphold his order denying relief. Although the record presents conflicting evidence, there is no direct evidence that a definitive plea offer was ever made between District Attorney Jacobs and Mr. Hulse. The record clearly shows that Mr. Hulse, under oath, unequivocally denied that any such offer was made and that the district attorney, Mr. Jacobs, does not recall whether any such offer was made. In light of these facts, and the record as a whole, we find that Judge Lane did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s Motion for Appropriate Relief.\\nNo error.',\n",

       "[{'text': \"NEWBY, Justice.\\nThe contractual right of foreclosure by power of sale under a deed of trust is a non-judicial proceeding. In the comprehensive statutory framework governing non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale set forth in Chapter 45 of our General Statutes, the General Assembly has prescribed certain minimal judicial procedures, including requiring notice and a hearing designed to protect the debtor’s interest. The hearing official then authorizes the foreclosure to proceed or refuses to do so. In this informal setting, a creditor must establish, among other things, the existence of a debt, default, and its right to foreclose, and a debtor may raise evidentiary challenges. The Rules of Civil Procedure applicable to formal judicial actions do not apply. The debtor has the option to file a separate judicial action to enjoin the foreclosure.\\nHere, because the creditor failed to establish the substitute trustee’s authority to foreclose under the deed of trust, the trial court properly refused to authorize the creditor to proceed with the foreclosure. Nonetheless, the trial court erroneously entered a “dismissal with prejudice.” The refusal to authorize the creditor to proceed is not a “dismissal”; it does not implicate res judicata or collateral estoppel in the traditional sense. While the creditor may not proceed with non-judicial foreclosure on the same default, it may proceed on the same default through foreclosure by judicial action. The creditor may also proceed non-judicially under power of sale based upon a different default. Because the Court of Appeals erred by finding that the creditor established the successor trustee’s authority to proceed under the deed of trust, we reverse the decision of that court, which reversed the trial court’s evidentiary ruling.\\nIn July 2006, Gordon F. Lucks (borrower) executed a promissory note with IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (the Note) in the principal amount of $225,000 to purchase real property situated in Buncombe County. The debt is repayable through monthly installments, with each payment due on the first of the month, and matures on 1 August 2036. The Note includes default and acceleration provisions.\\nAt the same time, borrower executed a deed of trust on the property, naming Robert R Tucker II as trustee, which was recorded with the Buncombe County Register of Deeds. The deed of trust provides for non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale. Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank) currently holds the Note and asserts that borrower “has not paid any amount due and owing under the Note since October 1, 2010.”\\nIn September 2013, the Ford Firm, acting as substitute trustee under the deed of trust, initiated a hearing for non-judicial foreclosure under N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16 for borrower’s failure to make payments. The Assistant Clerk of Superior Court, Buncombe County “dismissed” the case for failure to present documentation appointing the Ford Firm as substitute trustee.\\nIn June 2014, Cornish Law, PLLC, now acting as substitute trustee, initiated a new hearing for non-judicial foreclosure based on borrower’s failure to make payments. The Assistant Clerk found proper documentation established that “The Ford Firm was the Trustee at the time of the [prior] dismissal,” and since “Cornish Law, PLLC is in privity with The Ford Firm,” the “action is barred by Res Judicata” and again “dismissed” the case. Deutsche Bank appealed the matter to superior court. See N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(dl) (2015).\\nAt the de novo hearing in superior court, Deutsche Bank tendered a series of documents to establish the substitute trustee’s right to proceed with non-judicial foreclosure, which included various copies of powers of attorney. One such document, marked “Exhibit 4,” is the crucial document at issue in this appeal, without which the substitute trustee lacks authority to act under the deed of trust. The document is purported to be a limited power of attorney appointing a service company to act on Deutsche Bank’s behalf, which, in turn, was relied upon to appoint the substitute trustee.\\nDeutsche Bank called a witness who testified that she was “employed by” the service company, but Deutsche Bank did not establish her position, role, or duties in the handling of records. Regarding the document marked Exhibit 4, the employee stated that a different firm “prepared the power of attorney,” that “normally we record the power of attorneys,” and that, “[i]n this case we try to record it to the state ... where the headquarters would be,” which she “believe[d] . . . would be Charlotte.” The City of Charlotte is located in Mecklenburg County.\\nDeutsche Bank tendered Exhibit 4, which is a photocopy, fourteen pages in length, signed by a Bank officer on 21 November 2013 and notarized. The last page revealed a recording stamp from the Register of Deeds in Montgomery County, not Mecklenburg County, which states the document was recorded in 2010, three years before the purported execution, and that the document is eleven pages in length, not fourteen. Borrower objected to the Exhibit’s admission into evidence, noting the “recording information appears to precede the date of signatory on that instrument.” Counsel for Deutsche Bank stated that she “believe[d] that was an error in stapling the exhibit.” Nonetheless, no witness testified about the discrepancy. Deutsche Bank did not request the trial court take judicial notice of any recorded version of Exhibit 4 or make other arguments for the admission of Exhibit 4.\\nThe trial court sustained borrower’s objection to the admission of Exhibit 4 for “failure to provide a proper foundation and hearsay,” noting that “the document is internally inconsistent” and “has inconsistent dates.” Because Exhibit 4 is essential in establishing the substitute trustee’s authority to proceed with the foreclosure, the trial court “dismissed with prejudice” the case for insufficient evidence. Deutsche Bank timely appealed the matter to the Court of Appeals.\\nIn a divided opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s dismissal. In re Foreclosure of Lucks, _ N.C. App. _, 785 S.E.2d 185, 2016 WL 1321155 (2016) (unpublished). The majority noted that “the evidentiary rules are slightly more relaxed in the context of a foreclosure hearing than in normal litigation,” id., 2016 WL 1321155, at *2, and concluded that the trial court erred by sustaining borrower’s objection to Exhibit 4 “on the basis of lack of ‘proper foundation and hearsay,’ ” id. at *3. The dissent opined that any relaxation of the evidentiary rules “is not supported by citation or case law,” id. at *4 (Hunter, J., dissenting), and, noting borrower failed to establish alternative means to admit Exhibit 4, concluded the trial court properly excluded the Exhibit, id. at *7.. Borrower appeals as a matter of right.\\nNon-judicial foreclosure by power of sale arises under contract and is not a judicial proceeding. See In re Foreclosure of Michael Weinman Assocs. Gen. P’ship, 333 N.C. 221, 227, 424 S.E.2d 385, 388 (1993) (A' power of sale is contractual and allows the creditor to sell the mortgaged property “without any order of court in the event of a default.” (quoting James A. Webster, Jr., Webster’s Real Estate Law in North Carolina § 281, at 331 (Patrick K-Hetrick & James B. McLaughlin, Jr. eds., 3d ed. 1988))). Though states have adopted differing views, by at least 1830, North Carolina had allowed power of sale foreclosures under deed of trust. See Harrison v. Battle, 16 N.C. (1 Dev. Eq.) 537, 542 (1830).\\nThe General Assembly has crafted Chapter 45 to be the comprehensive and exclusive statutoiy framework governing non-judicial foreclosures by power of sale. E.g., N.C.G.S. §§ 45-21.16 (2015) (notice and hearing requirements), -21.26 (2015) (reporting of sale), -21.27 (2015) (upset bid), -21.29 (2015) (orders for possession); see also Durant M. Glover, Comment, Real Property—Changes in North Carolina’s Foreclosure Law, 54 N.C. L. Rev. 903, 913-15 (1976) (discussing the evolution of non-judicial foreclosure statutes). The Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply unless explicitly engrafted into the statute. E.g., N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(a) (requiring service as “provided by the Rules”); see also In re Ernst & Young, LLP, 363 N.C. 612, 620, 694 S.E.2d 151, 156 (2009) (holding that N.C.G.S. § 105-258(a) (2007) prescribed “its own specialized procedure that supplants the Rules”). By establishing an exclusive procedure, non-judicial foreclosure does not require the filing of an action. Nonetheless, Chapter 45 does require a minimal degree of judicial oversight for the sole purpose of requiring a creditor to establish its right to proceed with the foreclosure. See N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d). The creditor must give notice of a hearing. Id. § 45-21.16(a). Given the fluid nature of the debtor-creditor relationship and the state and federal oversight of foreclosure proceedings, there are multiple reasons why a creditor might choose not to proceed with the hearing. For example, a debtor may seek to remit late mortgage payments, or changes in law may alter foreclosure requirements, thus affecting the creditor’s ability to proceed. Such a decision to refrain from proceeding is not a “dismissal” but simply a withdrawal of the notice and has no collateral consequence.\\nSection 45-21.16 requires a creditor to give the debtor adequate notice of a hearing, which initially occurs before the clerk of court. See id. § 45-21.16(a), (d); see also In re Foreclosure of Goforth Props., Inc., 334 N.C. 369, 374, 432 S.E.2d 855, 858 (1993) (Section 45-21.16 does not “alter the essentially contractual nature of the remedy, but rather [ ] satisfies] the minimum due process requirements.” (quoting In re Foreclosure of Burgess, 47 N.C. App. 599, 603, 267 S.E.2d 915, 918, appeal dismissed, 301 N.C. 90 (1980))). The statute provides for a relaxation in the formal rules of evidence at the hearing. See N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d) (“The clerk . . . may consider, in addition to other forms of evidence required or permitted by law, affidavits and certified copies of documents.”). The creditor must show the existence of (i) a valid debt, (ii) default, (iii) the right to foreclose, (iv) notice, and (v) “home loan” classification and applicable pre-foreclosure notice, and (vi) that the sale is not barred by the debtor’s military service. Id. The evidentiary rules are the same when the trial court conducts a de novo hearing on an appeal from the clerk’s decision. See id. § 45-21.16(dl).\\nAt the hearing the debtor is free to raise evidentiary objections “tending to negate any of the [ ] findings required under N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16,” In re Goforth Props., 334 N.C. at 374-75, 432 S.E.2d at 859, or the debtor may seek to enjoin the foreclosure in a separate judicial action, N.C.G.S. § 45-21.34 (2015); see also id. § 45-21.17A(f), (g) (2015) (setting requirements for bringing actions to set aside the sale for failure to provide notice). Once the creditor has established the various elements of N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d), “the clerk shall authorize the [creditor] to proceed under the instrument.” Id. § 45-21.16(d).\\nIf the clerk or trial court does not find the evidence presented to be adequate to “authorize” the foreclosure sale, this finding does not implicate res judicata or collateral estoppel in the traditional sense. See Note, The Model Power of Sale Mortgage Foreclosure Act—An Appraisal, 27 Va. L. Rev. 926, 929 (1941) (“[T]he principle of res adjudicata is therefore not applicable to” the “extra-judicial method of foreclosure.”). While the creditor is prohibited from proceeding again with a nonjudicial foreclosure on the same default, the creditor can proceed with a judicial foreclosure. See N.C.G.S. § 45-21.2 (2015) (“This Article does not affect any right to foreclosure by action in court_”). Likewise, the creditor may proceed non-judicially on another default.\\n. “The competency, admissibility, and sufficiency of the evidence is a matter for the [trial] court to determine.” Queen City Coach Co. v. Lee, 218 N.C. 320, 323, 11 S.E.2d 341, 343 (1940). We review the trial court’s exclusion of documentary evidence under the hearsay rule for abuse of discretion. See State v. Blake, 317 N.C. 632, 637-38, 346 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1986); accord Home v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 4 F.3d 276, 283-84 (4th Cir. 1993). “A trial court may be reversed for abuse of discretion only upon a showing that its ruling was manifestly unsupported by reason and could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.” State v. Riddick, 315 N.C. 749, 756, 340 S.E.2d 55, 59 (1986) (citing, inter alia, White v. White, 312 N.C. 770, 777, 324 S.E.2d 829, 833 (1985)).\\nThe precise question before this Court is whether the trial court abused its discretion by finding Deutsche Bank failed to establish the appointment of the substitute trustee, a prerequisite to its right to proceed with non-judicial foreclosure, and if so, what is the effect of that decision. Exhibit 4 is essential to the substitute trustee’s appointment. Though the Court of Appeals majority was correct in noting that the evi-dentiary rules are more relaxed in the non-judicial foreclosure setting, given the significant internal inconsistencies in the power of attorney at issue and Deutsche Bank’s failure to present alternative grounds for admissibility, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit Exhibit 4 into evidence.\\nExhibit 4 is plainly internally inconsistent. See 5 John Henry Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law §§ 1421, 1422, at 253-54 (James H. Chaboum ed., 1974) (Trustworthiness and necessity are the hallmarks of admissibility.) Deutsche Bank tendered the Exhibit as a photocopy, fourteen pages in length, executed in 2013. The last page, which contains a recording stamp from the “Montgomery County, NC” Register of Deeds, indicates the Exhibit is only eleven pages in length and was recorded in 2010. Cf. id. § 1557, at 481 (explaining that “specific errors” undermine a record’s trustworthiness (emphasis omitted)). While there were ways to overcome the inconsistency, none were effectuated here. See, e.g., N.C.G.S. § 45-10(a) (2015) (allowing noteholder to appoint substitute trustee directly); id. § 45-21.16(d) (allowing “affidavits and certified copies”); see also id. § 8C-1, Rule 201(d) (2015) (judicial notice); id., Rule 803(6) (2015) (business records). Deutsche Bank could have provided a photocopy of the recorded document from the proper county register of deeds, but did not do so. See id. § 47-28(a) (2015) (“[P]owers of attorney affecting real property . . . shall be registered in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the principal is domiciled or where the real property lies.”).\\nThough the superior court correctly refused to authorize the substitute trustee to proceed, the court erroneously entered a “dismissal with prejudice.” Non-judicial foreclosure is not a judicial action; the Rules of Civil Procedure and traditional doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel applicable to judicial actions do not apply. To the extent that prior case law implies otherwise, such cases are hereby overruled. While it is true that Deutsche Bank is barred from proceeding again with non-judicial foreclosure based on the same default, the Bank may nonetheless proceed with foreclosure by judicial action. The Bank may also proceed with non-judicial foreclosure based upon a different default. The trial court’s order is to be interpreted consistent with this analysis.\\nThough the evidentiary requirements under non-judicial foreclosure proceedings are relaxed and there were ways to overcome the Exhibit’s inconsistencies, we cannot conclude the trial court had no reasonable basis to exclude Exhibit 4. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the evidentiary ruling of the trial court.\\nREVERSED.\\n1\\n.

Because a break in any one link in the chain leading to the appointment of the substitute trustee deprives the creditor of the authority to foreclose under the deed of trust, we need not analyze the other alleged deficiencies.

       " {'text': \"HUDSON, J.\\nconcurring in result.\\nI agree that this Court should reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and affirm the trial court’s dismissal of this attempt to foreclose by power of sale. I would focus, however, on the primary argument of the parties, which addresses whether the trial court properly excluded exhibits that were necessary to establish the right to foreclose. I agree with the majority that Exhibit 4 “is the crucial document at issue in this appeal.” Thus, we should review the trial court’s decision to exclude Exhibit 4 “based upon a failure to provide a proper foundation and hearsay.” I conclude that the trial court acted appropriately in excluding Exhibit 4.\\nIn addition, I would explain more fully and precisely the statutory basis for the proper scope of thé applicability of the Rules of Evidence and Rules of Civil Procedure in power-of-sale foreclosures. First, the majority agrees with the Court of Appeals majority’s broad statement that the evidentiary rules are more relaxed in the non-judicial foreclosure setting. I would clarify that the Rules of Evidence are relaxed only in the hearing before the clerk and only to the extent specifically provided for in N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d). In the de novo hearing in the trial court, however, the statute does not specifically provide for any relaxation of the rules, so the Rules of Evidence apply fully, as in any court proceeding, per Rules of Evidence 101 and 1101. N.C. R. Evid. 101 (These rules govern proceedings in the courts of this State to the extent and with the exceptions stated in Rule 1101.”); id. R. 1101 (“Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) or by statute, these rules apply to all actions and proceedings in the courts of this State.”).\\nSecond, the majority announces that the “Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply unless explicitly engrafted into the statute.” I do not agree. The very first sentence of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which are themselves a statutory enactment, provides: “These rules shall govern the procedure in the superior and district courts of the State of North Carolina in all actions and proceedings of a civil nature except when a differing procedure is prescribed by statute.” N.C. R. Civ. P. 1 (emphasis added) (titled “Scope of Rules”). I do not agree with the majority’s assertion that the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply “unless they are engrafted into the statute”; the Rules themselves presume they apply in all proceedings in the courts unless a different procedure is prescribed. I conclude this creates a presumption that these rules apply; the majority has turned this presumption around, citing no authority.\\nAdditionally, the statute distinguishes between the proceeding before the clerk and the de novo hearing in the trial court, although the majority does not. I would clarify that since N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16 prescribes a different procedure for the hearing before the clerk, see N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(c)-(dl) (2015), the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply; however, because the statute does not prescribe any such alternate procedure for the de novo hearing in the trial court, see id. § 45-21.16(e) (2015), I would conclude that the Rules of Civil Procedure apply there, as in any court proceeding, per Rule 1. As such, I concur in the result.\\n“When an appellate court reviews the decision of a trial court sitting without a jury, ‘findings of fact have the force and effect of a verdict by a jury and are conclusive on appeal if there is evidence to support them In re Foreclosure of Bass, 366 N.C. 464, 467, 738 S.E.2d 173, 175 (2013) (quoting Knutton v. Cofield, 273 N.C. 355, 359, 160 S.E.2d 29, 33 (1968) (citations omitted)). Conclusions of law are reviewable by the appellate court de novo. Id. at 467, 738 S.E.2d at 175 (citing Carolina Power & Light Co. v. City of Asheville, 358 N.C. 512, 517, 597 S.E.2d 717, 721 (2004)).\\nIt does not appear that this Court has addressed the standard of review of a trial court’s evidentiary determination in this particular context. The cases from the Court of Appeals are in conflict regarding whether an abuse of discretion or de novo standard of review is appropriate in the context of authentication of documentary evidence. Compare State v. Watlington, 234 N.C. App. 580, 590, 759 S.E.2d 116,124 (reviewing atrial court’s determination as to authentication of text messages de novo), disc. rev. denied, 367 N.C. 791, 766 S.E.2d 644 (2014), and State v. Crawley, 217 N.C. App. 509, 515, 719 S.E.2d 632, 637 (2011) (reviewing a trial court’s determination as to authentication of cell phone records de novo), disc. rev. denied, 365 N.C. 553, 722 S.E.2d 607 (2012), with In re Foreclosure by Goddard & Peterson, PLLC, _ N.C. App. __, _, 789 S.E.2d 835, 842 (2016) (reviewing evidentiary determinations by a trial court in a power-of-sale foreclosure proceeding for abuse of discretion), and Brown v. City of Winston-Salem, 176 N.C. App. 497, 505, 626 S.E.2d 747, 753 (using an abuse of discretion standard to review a trial court’s determination as to authentication of spreadsheets with data under Rule 901), cert, denied, 360 N.C. 575, 635 S.E.2d 429 (2006). In this concurring opinion, I need not make a determination about which standard of review should apply because the result would be the same under either standard.\\nHere the trial court concluded that Deutsche Bank (the Bank) “failed to offer sufficient evidence ... to proceed with the foreclosure.” The trial court found that the Bank “failed to prove [it] possessed the Right to Foreclose” after excluding several exhibits including Exhibit 4, which was essential to establishing the substitute trustee’s appointment. The trial court excluded Exhibit 4 “based upon a failure to provide a proper foundation and hearsay.” During the de novo hearing before the trial court, the trial court specifically noted, as to Exhibit 4, that “[t]he Court would determine this is not only a - taken no exception to hearsay rule, but also the document is internally inconsistent. I would further note this document is presented to the Court from counsel which has inconsistent dates.” Thus, the precise issue before this Court is whether the trial court acted appropriately in excluding Exhibit 4.\\nSubsection 45-21.16(d) specifically explains that in the hearing before the clerk, “the clerk shall consider the evidence of the parties and may consider, in addition to other forms of evidence required or permitted by law, affidavits and certified copies of documents.” N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d) (emphasis added). This provision allows affidavits to be used in place of live testimony when “the ‘necessity for expeditious procedure’ substantially outweighs any concerns about the efficacy of allowing [the witness] to testify by affidavit.” In re Foreclosure of Brown, 156 N.C. App. 477, 486, 577 S.E.2d 398, 404-05 (2003) (quoting In re Custody of Griffin, 6 N.C. App. 375, 378, 170 S.E.2d 84, 86 (1969)). The statute also allows clerks to consider “certified copies of documents,” presumably in place of originals. N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d). The statute allows for these particular forms of evidence “in addition to other forms of evidence required or permitted by law.” Id. (emphasis added). This means that aside from this narrow exception for affidavits and certified copies of documents, the other evidence that the “clerk shall consider,” id., must generally conform to the Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, I conclude that the Rules of Evidence are relaxed in power-of-sale foreclosure hearings before the clerk only to the extent specifically provided for in N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(d).\\nI further conclude that in a de novo hearing before the trial court, the Rules of Evidence apply fully, as in any court proceeding, per Rules of Evidence 101 and 1101. N.C. R. Evid. 101 (These rules govern proceedings in the courts of this State to the extent and with the exceptions stated in Rule 1101.”); id. R. 1101 (“Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) or by statute, these rules apply to all actions and proceedings in the courts of this State.”). Subsection 45-21.16(e) does not specifically provide for any relaxation of the rules of evidence for the court proceeding, as it does in subsection 45-21.16(d), for the hearing before the clerk.\\nThe Bank sought to introduce Exhibit 4, which is a photocopy “of a document purporting to be a Limited Power of Attorney granting certain powers to Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC.” There is no stamp on Exhibit 4 certifying the exhibit as a true and accurate copy; thus, it is an uncerti-fied copy.\\nThe trial court specifically noted that the document has internal inconsistencies, particularly with dates and numbers of pages. The trial court also noted the lack of a “proper foundation.” I conclude that the trial court acted appropriately in excluding the document on this basis, regardless of the applicable standard of review.\\nAs noted above, I conclude that once this matter reached the superior court, the Rules of Evidence applied. Under the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, “[e]veiy writing sought to be admitted must be properly authenticated” in order to establish the foundation for the document’s admissibility. Inv’rs Title Ins. Co. v. Herzig, 330 N.C. 681, 693, 413 S.E.2d 268, 274 (1992) (citations omitted). Rule 901 states that “[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” N.C. R. Evid. 901(a). Rule 901 provides a nonexclusive list of ways evidence may be authenticated, including “Testimony of Witness with Knowledge” and' “Public Records or Reports.” Id. R. 901(b)(1), (7).\\nRule 902 provides for methods of self-authentication, of evidence. Specifically, “[e]xtrinsic evidence of authenticity... is not required with respect to the following: ... (4) Certified Copies of Public Records . . . [and] (8) Acknowledged Documents.” Id. R. 902.\\nThe Bank’s attorney here did question a five witness (Ms. Lyew) but in so doing, failed to lay enough of a foundation to establish the authenticity of Exhibit 4. Counsel did not elicit testimony regarding the witness’s job responsibilities, work experience, time of employment with Ocwen, or any other details showing her personal knowledge of the documents and loan in question. This testimony failed to satisfy minimal authentication requirements. Additionally, while evidence that a public record or report “is from the public office where items of this nature are kept” could serve to authenticate this document to the extent this document may qualify as a public record or report, id. R. 901(b)(7), the recording stamp included with Exhibit 4 contradicts the document itself and indicates that it was recorded in “Montgomery County, NC,” and not “Charlotte” (Mecklenburg County), as the witness testified should be the case here. As such, there is no indication that this document was in fact recorded or, if so, where. Thus, Exhibit 4 does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 901. Finally, any argument under Rule 902 fails because the parties did not present that argument before the trial court.\\nIn addition to not being authenticated, Exhibit 4 is internally inconsistent. As the majority notes, the recording stamp on Exhibit 4 indicates that the document is eleven pages in length and was recorded in 2010 in Montgomery County, North Carolina. In fact, the actual Exhibit 4 document is fourteen pages in length, was executed in 2013, and should have been recorded in Mecklenburg County, according to the witness.\\nBecause Exhibit 4 is not a certified copy and it contained internal inconsistencies, and because no witness testified to personal knowledge about it, the trial court acted appropriately in excluding Exhibit 4, regardless of the applicable standard of review. Without Exhibit 4, the Bank failed to offer sufficient evidence of the right to proceed with a power-of-sale foreclosure. The trial court’s conclusion is supported by the findings of fact and by the evidence. Accordingly, the trial court’s dismissal on this basis was entirely appropriate.\\nIn addition, I agree with the majority that the Bank “is barred from proceeding again with non-judicial foreclosure based on the same default, [and that] the Bank may nonetheless proceed with foreclosure by judicial action.” To reach that conclusion, however, I do not think it necessary or consistent with applicable statutory authority to deem the Rules of Civil Procedure inapplicable.\\nTurning to the foreclosure procedure at issue here, it is clear to me that in N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16 (codified in “Part 2. Procedure for Sale [Under Power of Sale]”), the General Assembly has prescribed by statute a different procedure for the hearing before the clerk. The details of that procedure are explained in subsections (c) through (dl) of N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16. If and when the matter is “appealed to the judge of the district or superior court,” it is to be reviewed in a de novo hearing. N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(dl). Once the case has moved into the district or superior court for the de novo hearing before a judge “who shall be authorized to hear the appeal,” no further procedure is prescribed for that stage of the litigation. Id. § 45-21.16(e). Subsection (e) requires only that “[a] certified copy of any order entered as a result of the appeal shall be filed in all counties where the notice of hearing has been filed.” Id. Because no differing procedure is prescribed in N.C.G.S. § 45-21.16(e) for the proceeding in the district or superior court, I conclude that the Rules of Civil procedure apply there, in accordance with Rule 1. See N.C. R. Civ. P. 1,\\nUpon appeal from the clerk’s determination, the trial court excluded Exhibit 4 and properly concluded that the Bank failed to establish its right to foreclose by power of sale. Dismissal of the matter, under the Rules of Civil Procedure, was the proper ruling at that point. Nonetheless, as to the claim based on this default, the Bank may still proceed with foreclosure by judicial action. See N.C.G.S. § 45-21.2 (2015) (“This Article [“Article 2A. Sales Under Power of Sale”] does not affect any right to foreclosure by action in court, and is not applicable to any such action.”).\\nFor the reasons set forth herein, I concur in the result.\\nJustices BEASLEY and ERVIN join in this concurring opinion.\\n1\\n. The minority opinion announces an abuse of discretion standard for reviewing “the trial court’s exclusion of documentary evidence under the hearsay rule” and cites this Court’s decision in State v. Blake, 317 N.C. 632, 637-38, 346 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1986). First, Blake does not support this statement. Blake states that “[r]ulings on questions arguably leading rest in the trial court’s discretion and will not be disturbed in the absence of an abuse of discretion.” Blake, 317 N.C. at 637,346 S.E.2d at 402. In support of this statement, Blake cites State v. Young, 312, N.C. 669, 326 S.E.2d 181 (1985), which states that “[r]ulings by the trial court on leading questions are discretionary and reversible only for abuse of discretion.” Young, 312 N.C. at 678, 325 S.E.2d at 187. Both cases specifically address the standard of review relating to leading questions. Neither case articulates a standard of review for evidentiary determinations under the hearsay rule. In fact, when Blake does discuss the hearsay issue, it seems to employ, although without specifically saying, a de novo review. See Blake, 317 N.C. at 638, 346 S.E.2d at 402.\\nAdditionally, there are several cases from the Court of Appeals that explicitly utilize a de novo standard for reviewing trial court determinations regarding hearsay. See, e.g., State v. Hicks, _ N.C. App. _, _, 777 S.E.2d 341, 348 (2015) (“This Court reviews atrial court’s ruling on the admission of evidence over a party’s hearsay objection de novo.” (citing State v. Miller, 197 N.C. App. 78, 87-88, 676 S.E.2d 546, 552, disc. rev. denied, 363 N.C. 586, 683 S.E.2d 216 (2009))), disc. rev. denied, 368 N.C. 686, 781 S.E.2d 606 (2016); State v. Castaneda, 215 N.C. App. 144, 147, 715 S.E.2d 290, 293 (“The trial court’s determination as to whether an out-of-court statement constitutes hearsay is reviewed de novo on appeal.” (quoting State v. Mitler, 197 N.C. App. 78, 87-88, 676 S.E.2d 646, 552, disc. rev. denied, 363 N.C. 586, 683 S.E.2d 216 (2009)), appeal dismissed and disc. rev. denied, 365 N.C. 354, 718 S.E.2d 148 (2011).\\nSecond, it is not clear why the majority announces a specific, possibly new standard of review relating to hearsay when it does not analyze whether Exhibit 4 is hearsay or fits within a hearsay exception here. The majority simply concludes that because Exhibit 4 is “plainly internally inconsistent,” the majority “cannot conclude the trial court had no reasonable basis to exclude” it.\\n2\\n. Because this matter can be resolved based upon the trial court’s exclusion of Exhibit 4 for failure to provide a proper foundation, in my view this Court need not reach the alternate ground for inadmissibility noted by the trial court, i.e., hearsay.\\n3\\n. Rule 901 reads in pertinent part:\\n(b) Illustrations.- By way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation, the following are examples of authentication or identification conforming with the requirements of this rule:\\n(1) Testimony of Witness with Knowledge.- Testimony that a matter is what it is claimed to be.\\n(7) Public Records or Reports.- Evidence that a writing authorized by law to be recorded or filed and in fact recorded or filed in a public office, or a purported public record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form, is from the public office where items of this nature are kept.\\nN.C.
